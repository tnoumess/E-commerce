Assignment 11: eCommerce Project

General Description:

Identify an eCommerce need for a product or service and implement a working prototype
using Amazon Web Services. 

Example Project:

	Select a public, web-based data item: weather, stock, social, etc, and build an
	alert service that sends an update message to subscribers whenever it changes by
	a selected amount.  For example, if the outdoor temperature reported in Fairfax
	changes by more than 5 degrees in one hour, send an alert; or if the price of 
	Google stock increases by more than 2% over the previous day, send an alert.
	Implement this service using AWS.  Create a business plan describing how to 
	monetize this service as an eCommerce opportunity.  Who are your customers?
	Why would they pay for your service?  What extra features might you support?
	Describe what would happen if millions of subscribers per day started using 
	your service.
